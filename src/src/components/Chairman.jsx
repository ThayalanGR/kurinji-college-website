                            during our endeavors.
                            With greater humility I would like to state that we have crossed a milestone of twelve years in Technical
                            Education and Training which was laced with a perspective of reaching milestones at every stage.
                            It was achieved with immaculate discipline, quality training, rigorous practices, continuous improvement and
                            total staff involvement and with an eye on future scenario in Technical Education.
                            The institution provides world className infrastructural facilities comparable with the best of its kind in the
                    field of education.</p>
